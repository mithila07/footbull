To keep the platform democratic, players can do marketing tasks to be allocated free boxes, however for a better chance at better players & if you want to skip the tasks, players and investors will be able to pay to open boxes. 50% of the proceeds from NFT minting will be bought into the $FBull token. There will also be a reselling market of the cards, as more valuable players are sold for more.
